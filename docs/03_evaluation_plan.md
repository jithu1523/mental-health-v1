# Evaluation Plan

Metrics:
- Adherence: check-ins per week and retention over time.
- Streaks: consecutive days of micro and daily check-ins.
- Response quality: proportion of entries flagged low quality.
- Trend sensitivity: ability to detect sustained changes without overreacting to noise.
- Error analysis: qualitative review of false positives/false negatives in crisis flags.

Approach:
- Track adherence and streaks to assess usability.
- Use quality gating to avoid noise-driven trends.
- Compare baseline drift signals with user-reported context.
- Record and review crisis flag triggers for conservative safety behavior.
