# MindTriage Overview

MindTriage is a local-first mental health check-in tool that combines daily journaling, rapid triage, and quality gating to help users track changes over time without sending data to the cloud. It offers two evaluation paths: a short rapid assessment for acute state and a daily check-in for longitudinal trend tracking, with an optional micro check-in to reinforce habits.

The product emphasizes:
- Local-first data storage with export/import.
- Transparent, rule-based scoring and drift detection.
- Conservative safety guardrails that surface resources when crisis signals appear.
- Minimal friction for daily use with a calm, non-clinical UI.

MindTriage is not a diagnosis tool. It is designed to support self-awareness and routing to help when needed.
