# Problem and Gap

Many mental health journaling apps focus on freeform writing or mood tracking but fall short in a few areas:
- Little support for rapid, structured triage when someone needs immediate guidance.
- Limited data quality controls, which weakens trends and interpretability.
- Cloud-first designs that can be a barrier for privacy-sensitive users.

MindTriage addresses these gaps by combining:
- Local-first storage with anonymized export.
- Rapid evaluation for acute state plus daily check-ins for longitudinal insight.
- Quality filtering so trends are based on higher signal entries.
