# Privacy and Ethics

MindTriage is local-first by default:
- Data lives on the user's device in a local SQLite database.
- Exports are anonymized by default and are user-controlled.
- No user data is sent to cloud services.

Ethical commitments:
- Clear safety language and guidance when crisis signals appear.
- Conservative guardrails that prefer false positives to false negatives.
- No PHI or real user data in this repository.

MindTriage is not medical advice and is not a substitute for professional care.
