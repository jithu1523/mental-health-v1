# Method

MindTriage uses a deterministic, rules-based pipeline to avoid opaque scoring:

1) Rapid Evaluation (acute)
- Short questionnaire to assess immediate state.
- Produces a risk level and a set of explanation signals.

2) Daily Check-in (regular)
- Core questions + rotating questions to reduce repetition.
- Produces daily risk scores and trend signals.

3) Journal
- Free-text journaling with optional quality gating.

4) Trend and Baseline
- Risk history and baseline drift are computed from high-quality entries.

Not a diagnosis: MindTriage provides supportive check-ins and signals, not medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
